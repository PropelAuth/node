PropelAuth's Node library provides all the building blocks you need to add authentication to your Node projects. You should prefer the [Cloudflare Workers](https://docs.propelauth.com/reference/backend-apis/cloudflare-workers), [Express](https://docs.propelauth.com/reference/backend-apis/express), or [Next.js libraries](https://docs.propelauth.com/reference/fullstack-apis/nextjsapp/automatic-installation) if you are using those frameworks, as they provide a more first-class experience, however, this library can be used in any Node project.
